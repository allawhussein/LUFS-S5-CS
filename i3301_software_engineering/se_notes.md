# Chapter 0: Introduction

- software costs more than hardware
- software maintenance cost more than its development.
- software profits are mainly in maintenance not in development, especially when the customer is locked into our software.
- SE includes methodologies, techniques and tools to develop software.
- software cost is rougly 60% development and 40% testing
- software quality and software cost are inversely proportional

## Definition:
Software engineering is an organized, analytical approach to the design, development, use and maintenance of software.

It includes techqniques to avoid many lethal drawbacks. It provides us with hte flexibility to accomedate for unexpected demands, while avoiding overtime or overbudget.

## Software Products
- Generic
- Customized, accomdiate for special needs with a niche market (embbeded control systems, air traffic control software)

## Software Challenges
- HeterogeneiIssuesty, software is required to be cross-devices or cross-platform.
- Business and social change
- security and trust

## Terminologies & FAQs
- **Software**: a set of linked programs and associated docuemntation.
- **Attributes of good software**: maintainable, dependable and usable.
- **Software engineering**: already defined
- **fundamental activities**: software specification, development, validation and maintenance.
- **CS vs SE**: the first focuses on theory and fundamentals, the second on the practicalities of developing and delivering the software.
- **software engineering vs systems engineering**: the first focuses on software only, the systems take hardware engineering into consideration.

## Fundamentals Attributes of Good Software
- **Maintablity** (critical)
- **Reliablity**, should cause minimal physical or economical damage in the even of system failure
- **Security**, should prevent malicious users from accessing or damaging the system
- **Efficiency**, shouldn't be wasteful of system resources, includes responsiveness, processing time
- **Acceptability**, target uses should be able to yield the program efficiently

## Application Types:
- **Stand-alone**, runable offline on local computer.
- **Interative Transaction-based**, applications executed on remote computer, and are accessed by the user online. web application belong to this category
- **Embedded Control**
- **Batch/Collection Processing**
- **Entertainment**
- **Modelling and Simulation**
- **Data Collection Systems**
- **Systems of Systems**
