There's criteria for any software developement, one of them is the modularity to facilitate the software's maintenance.

## Modularity

The degree to which a system's componenets may be separated and recombined. The concept is applicable to both hardware and software.

### Modularity in Programming and Design

It is breaking down a complex system in to smaller parts of componenets. First we split according to the three-tier architecture (MVC) or according to OOP.

### Goals of Modularity
provide the following:  
1. develop extendable, readable, reliable, reusable, maintainable components
2. facilitate problem understanding by dividing it
3. facilitate testing and debugging
4. facilitate software upgradability
5. facilitate team work
